# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report (possible) security issues in go-mail, please either send a mail to 
[security@go-mail.dev](mailto:security@go-mail.dev) or use Github's 
[private reporting feature](https://github.com/wneessen/go-mail/security/advisories/new).
Reports are always welcome. Even if you are not 100% certain that a specific issue you found
counts as a security issue, we'd love to hear the details, so we can figure out together if
the issue in question needds to be addressed.

Typically, you will receive an answer within a day or even within a few hours.
